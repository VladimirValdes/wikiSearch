## Overview

![screenshot](src/assets/wiki.gif)

WikiSearch is an app that I learned how to create it watching this [video](https://youtu.be/cPKbI4d0ruU) by [DOMINICODE](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3QuZuJr2_EOUak8bWUd74A) also I redesigned the app and I added some new features.

My experience developing this project was very successful I learned how to use the API of Wikipedia, how to use the Rxjs operators like debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged, and also I learned how to create a loading spinner using interceptors in angular.
